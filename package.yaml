name: nitta
version: 0.0.0.1
synopsis: CAD for reconfigurable real-time ASIP
description: |-
  Application area:

  - developing cyber-physical systems which are based on adaptive robust
  control algorithms and artificial intelligence with high requirements on
  latency and computational volume, power and area consumption;
  - developing hardware programmable accelerators and co-processors;
  - developing dynamically reconfigurable IP-core and soft-core for FPGA;
  - developing problem-oriented programmable ASIC.

  Project goals:

  - rapid prototyping of control and cyber-physical systems;
  - hardware in the loop simulation;
  - target system synthesis and its components;
  - integration of the real-time system with nonreal-time environment and
  automation of its interaction;
  - developing of IP-core for embedded systems and systems on a chip.

  Key features:

  - the orientation on model-driven engineering and not on software
  engineering;
  - automation of most of the development stages, including algorithm and
  model design and functional simulation, prototyping and complex
  verification, complex automatisation of cross-layer testing and
  synthesis and optimisation of a target system;
  - deeply computational platform reconfiguration on hardware, software and
  tool levels, transparency of CAD system workflow.
