Stability   : experimental

A multilevel process is an object with a complex internal structure. Process description should
contain every step (including start and finish time), and relations between them (Vertical or
sequence). It is possible to define process manually, but, in practice, is preferred to use 'State'
based builder from that module.

It also agreed to the process inspection.
