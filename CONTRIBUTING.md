## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- For Haskell you should use:
  - [fourmolu](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fourmolu);
  - [hlint](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlint);
- For TypeScript, HTML and CSS you should use [Prettier](https://prettier.io);
- For Verilog:
  - non-blocking assginment is more prefferable (`<=`);
  - keep naming convention for process unit interface (see );
  <!-- * you should use iStyle for source code and for auto-generated source code. -->
